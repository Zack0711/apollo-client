// When we say an object is "canonical" in programming, we mean it has
// earned a place in some abstract "canon" of official/blessed objects.
// This Canon class is a representation of such a collection, with the
// property that canon.add(value1) === canon.add(value2) if value1 and
// value2 are deeply equal to each other. The canonicalization process
// involves looking at every property in the provided object tree, so it
// takes the same order of time as deep equality checking (linear time),
// but already-canonized objects are returned immediately from canon.add,
// so ensuring subtrees have already been canonized tends to speed up
// canonicalization. Of course, since canonized objects may be shared
// widely between unrelated consumers, it's important to regard them as
// immutable. No detection of cycles is needed by the StoreReader class
// right now, so we don't bother keeping track of objects we've already
// seen during the recursion of the add method. Objects whose internal
// class name is neither Array nor Object can be included in the value
// tree, but they will not be replaced with a canonical version (to put it
// another way, they are assumed to be canonical already). We can easily
// add additional cases to the switch statement to handle other common
// object types, such as "[object Date]" objects, as needed.
